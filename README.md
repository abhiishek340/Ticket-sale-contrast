## Implementation Details

### Contract Functions

1. **Constructor**
```solidity
constructor(uint numTickets, uint price)
```
- Creates ticket sale with specified number and price
- Sets deployer as manager

2. **Buy Ticket**
```solidity
function buyTicket(uint ticketId) payable
```
- Purchases ticket by ID
- Requires exact payment
- One ticket per address

3. **Get Ticket Information**
```solidity
function getTicketOf(address person) public view returns (uint)
```
- Returns ticket ID owned by address
- Returns 0 if no ticket owned

4. **Swap Functions**
```solidity
function offerSwap(uint ticketId)
function acceptSwap(uint ticketId)
```
- Create and accept swap offers
- Atomic swap execution

5. **Resale Functions**
```solidity
function resaleTicket(uint price)
function acceptResale(uint ticketId) payable
```
- List tickets for resale
- Process 10% service fee
- Transfer ownership

6. **Check Resale**
```solidity
function checkResale() public view returns (uint[] memory)
```
- View available resale tickets
